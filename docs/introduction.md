# Introduction

Hey there! Welcome to the Crux App's documentation site ðŸ‘‹

Whether you're a gym climber, home wall climber, or climbing gym owner, you'll find all the information you need to get started with Crux right here.

## What is Crux?

At a high level, Crux is a climbing app that lets climbers set custom climbs on climbing walls, both at home and in climbing gyms. It's a great way to track your progress, discover new challenges, and excercise your creativity at the gym.

The "secret sauce" of Crux is our ability to scan images instantly for holds. This means you can take a photo of a wall, tap on the holds, and share the climb instantly, without any forms, payment, or waiting. At a climbing gym, this means you can set climbs _anywhere_ in the gym, a feature that's unique to Crux.

## Who's using Crux?

Crux has been used by over 30,000 climbers from over 50 countries. We've partnered with more than 100 commercial climbing gyms and are used at thousands of home-walls around the world. Over 100,000 climbs have been set with Crux, and we're just getting started!
