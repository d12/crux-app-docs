# Support Crux on Patreon

Did you know that Crux is a small, independent company? We built Crux because it's something we're passionate about, and we offer it for free to homewalls and individual climbers in an effort to make our software as accessible as possible.

That being said, we still need to pay the bills to keep Crux online. For those costs, we lean on our commercial gym partners and our Patrons on Patreon.

## What do we spend money on?

In no particular order, here are some of the things we spend money on to operate and develop Crux:

- **Server costs**: We use Heroku and Modal to host our servers, inference instances, and databases. These each have monthly recurring costs.
- **Storage costs**: We store all images and videos uploaded to Crux with Cloudflare. This has a monthly cost that gets more expensive as our user base grows and we store more data.
- **Hardware**: Some of our compute needs are served by our own physical hardware which is purchased and maintained by Crux.
- **Marketing costs**: We spend money to promote Crux to new users and climbing gyms. This includes things like advertisements, creator partnerships, marketing tools, and more.
- **Graphic design**: We hire a designer contractor to help with our graphic design needs, including posters, stickers, social media projects, and other graphical needs.
- **Marketing hardware**: We print and mail stickers, posters, flyers, and more to help get the word out about Crux.
- **Professional services**: Crux is a business that requires legal services, accounting, and more.
