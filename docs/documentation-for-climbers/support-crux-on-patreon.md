# Support Crux on Patreon

Crux is a **small, independent company** built by climbers, for climbers. Weâ€™re passionate about making Crux **accessible and free** for homewalls and individual climbers.

However, keeping Crux online requires resources. To cover these costs, we rely on **our commercial gym partners** and the **support of our Patrons on Patreon**.

## What Do We Spend Money On?

Running and improving Crux comes with ongoing costs, including:

- **Server Costs** â€“ Hosting our servers, inference instances, and databases on **Heroku and Modal** incurs recurring monthly expenses.
- **Storage Costs** â€“ **Cloudflare** stores all images and videos uploaded to Crux. As our user base grows, storage costs increase.
- **Hardware** â€“ Some of our computing power comes from **physical hardware** that we purchase and maintain.
- **Marketing** â€“ We invest in **advertising, creator partnerships, and marketing tools** to reach more climbers and gyms.
- **Graphic Design** â€“ We work with **design contractors** for posters, stickers, social media assets, and branding needs.
- **Printed Materials** â€“ We print and distribute **stickers, posters, flyers, and more** to spread the word about Crux.
- **Professional Services** â€“ Running a business means paying for **legal services, accounting, and operational costs**.
