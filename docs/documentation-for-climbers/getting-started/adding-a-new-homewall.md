# Adding a New Homewall

## How Much Does It Cost?

Adding a homewall to Crux is completely free! Homewalls get full access to all features, including unlimited walls, resets, and climbs.

## Who Can Set on My Homewall?

By default, only you can set routes on your homewall. If you’d like to allow others to set climbs, check out the [Adding and Removing Setters guide](/docs/documentation-for-climbers/homewall-specific-features/adding-and-removing-setters.md).

## How to Add Your Homewall

1. **Start the process** – Tap **"Add a commercial gym or home wall"** on the gym selection page. (See [Selecting Your Gym](/docs/documentation-for-climbers/getting-started/selecting-your-gym.md) for details.)
2. **Enter homewall details** – Provide your homewall’s name and location. Select **"Home climbing wall"** as the type.
3. **(Optional) Add a banner image** – This is decorative only and won’t affect route setting.
4. **Choose a grading system** – Select V grades, Font grades, or a custom grading scheme.
5. **Review and confirm** – Double-check the details, then tap **"Add gym"** to create your homewall. That’s it!
