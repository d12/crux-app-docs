# Adding a new homewall

## How much does it cost to add a homewall?

Homewalls get access to all features on Crux for free. This includes unlimited walls, resets, and climbs.

## Who can set on my home wall?

By default, only you can set on your home wall. To add setters, refer to the [adding and removing setters documentation](/docs/documentation-for-climbers/homewall-specific-features/adding-and-removing-setters.md).

## How do I add my homewal?

1. Begin the gym creation process by clicking "Add a commercial gym or home wall" on the gym selection page. Additional instructions can be found [here](/docs/documentation-for-climbers/getting-started/selecting-your-gym.md).
2. On the first page, enter the gym's name and location. Select "Home climbing wall" for the type.
3. Optionally upload a banner image. This is purely decorative and is not used to verify the gym or set climbs.
4. Specify your grading scheme. This can be V grades, Font grades, or a custom scheme.
5. Verify the gym info, then click "Add gym" to create the gym. That's it!
