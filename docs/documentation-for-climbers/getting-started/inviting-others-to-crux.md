# Inviting Others to Crux

Climbing is better with friends! Inviting others to join you on Crux makes the experience more fun and collaborative. Here’s how to get them started.

## Commercial Gyms

If you climb at a commercial gym, inviting friends is easy—just have them **download the Crux app** and search for your gym.

Commercial gyms on Crux are **open by default**, meaning anyone can join, view climbs, and set routes without special permissions.

For more details, check out the guide on [Downloading Crux and Signing In](/docs/documentation-for-climbers/getting-started/downloading-crux-and-signing-in.md#downloading-crux).

## Homewalls

Anyone can join and view your homewall, but only specific climbers can **set climbs**.

To manage who can set on your homewall, check out the [Adding and Removing Setters guide](/docs/documentation-for-climbers/homewall-specific-features/adding-and-removing-setters.md).
