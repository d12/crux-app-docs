# Inviting others to Crux

If you climb with others, you'll get a lot more out of Crux by inviting them to join you on Crux. Here's how you can do that.

## Commercial gyms

If you're a member of a commercial gym, all you need to do is have your friends download the app and search for your gym. Commercial gyms are open-by-default and don't require special permissions to join or set climbs. For more info, see the [downloading crux documentation](/docs/documentation-for-climbers/getting-started/downloading-crux-and-signing-in.md#downloading-crux)

## Homewalls

Anyone can join and view your homewall, but only a specific set of climbers can set climbs. To configure your homewall setters, see the [adding and removing setters documentation](/docs/documentation-for-climbers/homewall-specific-features/adding-and-removing-setters.md).
