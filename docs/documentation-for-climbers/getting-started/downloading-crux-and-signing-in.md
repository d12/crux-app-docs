# Downloading the Crux app and signing in

## Downloading Crux

You can download Crux for free from the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/climbwithcrux/id6448704757) or [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ca.cruxapp.twa). If you're looking to share a download link with someone else, [https://www.cruxapp.ca/download](https://www.cruxapp.ca/download) will redirect them to the appropriate store for their device.

## Signing in

When you open Crux for the first time, you'll be asked to sign in. You can sign in with either your Apple or Google account. All of your Crux data is associated to this account, so make sure to always sign in with the same method!

After signing in once, you will not need to sign in again unless you log out or delete the app. You can sign out by going to the "Profile" tab, and tapping the settings cog in the top right, then scrolling down to "Log out".
