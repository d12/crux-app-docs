# Selecting your gym

When you first sign up for Crux, you'll be asked to select your gym. This is the gym that you'd like to use the Crux app at. If you're a member at multiple gyms, you can switch between gyms at any time.

Use the search bar to search for your gym by name.

## Changing your selected gym

If you'd like to change your selected gym, you can do so by clicking the "Change gym" button in the top left of the gym page. This will open the gym selection dialog where you can search for and select a new gym.

## Gym not listed?

If your gym isn't listed, or you're adding a new homewall, click on "Add a commercial gym or home wall" below the continue button to add your gym. For additional info, see the next two articles on adding gyms to Crux, [adding a new commercial gym](/docs/documentation-for-climbers/getting-started/adding-a-new-commercial-gym.md) and [adding a new homewall](/docs/documentation-for-climbers/getting-started/adding-a-new-homewall.md).
