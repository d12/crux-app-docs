# Selecting Your Gym

When you first sign up for Crux, you'll be asked to select a gym. This is where you'll primarily use the app. If you climb at multiple gyms, don't worryâ€”you can switch between them anytime.

Use the search bar to find your gym by name.

## Changing Your Selected Gym

Need to switch gyms? Tap the **"Change gym"** button in the top left of the gym page. This will open the gym selection screen, where you can search for and select a new gym.

## Gym Not Listed?

If your gym isn't listed, or you're adding a new homewall, tap **"Add a commercial gym or home wall"** below the Continue button.
