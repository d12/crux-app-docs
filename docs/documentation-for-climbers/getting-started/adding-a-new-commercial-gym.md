# Adding a new commercial gym

## Who can add a commercial gym?

You do not need to be a gym staff member to add a commercial gym to Crux. You'll be the gym owner on Crux unless your gym decides to upgrade and take ownership of the gym.

## How much does it cost to add a commercial gym to Crux?

There is no cost to add a commercial gym to Crux. Your gym can optionally upgrade the gym's plan at a future date if they choose for a fee.

## How do I add a commercial gym?

1. Begin the gym creation process by clicking "Add a commercial gym or home wall" on the gym selection page. Additional instructions can be found [here](/docs/documentation-for-climbers/getting-started/selecting-your-gym.md).
2. On the first page, enter the gym's name and location. Select "Commercial climbing gym" for the type.
3. Optionally upload a banner image. This is purely decorative and is not used to verify the gym or set climbs.
4. Specify your grading scheme. This can be V grades, Font grades, or a custom scheme.
5. Verify the gym info, then click "Add gym" to create the gym. That's it!
