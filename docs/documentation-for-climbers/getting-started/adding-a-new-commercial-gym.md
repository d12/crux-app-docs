# Adding a New Commercial Gym

## Who Can Add a Commercial Gym?

Anyone can add a commercial gym to Crux—you don’t need to be a gym staff member. When you add a gym, you’ll initially be listed as the gym owner in Crux. If the gym decides to upgrade, they can take official ownership of the gym profile.

## How Much Does It Cost?

Adding a commercial gym to Crux is completely free. If the gym wants to unlock additional features, they can choose to upgrade to a paid plan later.

## How to Add a Commercial Gym

1. **Start the process** – Tap **"Add a commercial gym or home wall"** on the gym selection page. (For more details, see [Selecting Your Gym](/docs/documentation-for-climbers/getting-started/selecting-your-gym.md).)
2. **Enter gym details** – Provide the gym’s name and location. Select **"Commercial climbing gym"** as the type.
3. **(Optional) Add a banner image** – This is purely decorative and won’t affect route setting or verification.
4. **Choose a grading system** – Select V grades, Font grades, or a custom grading scheme.
5. **Review and confirm** – Double-check the details, then tap **"Add gym"** to create the gym. Done!
