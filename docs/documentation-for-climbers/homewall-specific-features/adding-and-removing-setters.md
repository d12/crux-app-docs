# Adding and removing setters in homewalls

:::info
Note that this feature only applies to homewalls. In commercial gyms, anyone is able to set climbs.
:::

By default, only the creator of the homewall is allowed to set climbs. Other climbers can view the wall but will see the "add climb" button grayed out.

## Adding or removing setters

To add or remove setters, head to your homewall's page, click on the "Settings" button, then click "Setters". From there, you can search for climbers by name and add them as setters. You can also remove setters by clicking garbage can icon beside their name.

### Admin permission

With the admin permission, a setter will be able to access the gym settings to edit the gym info, add setters, or unset climbs. Without the admin permission, a setter will only be able to set climbs.

## Setter limits

Homewalls start off with a limit of 2 setters to prevent abuse. You can email us at [contact@cruxapp.ca](mailto:contact@cruxapp.ca) to get this limit raised to 5.

If you need additional setters, we offer 10 or unlimited setters to our Patrons depending on the tier. You can learn more on [our Patreon page.](https://www.patreon.com/crux_climbing_app)
