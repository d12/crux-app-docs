## Adding or Removing Setters

To **add or remove setters**:
1. Go to your **homewall page**.
2. Tap **"Settings"**.
3. Select **"Setters."**
4. Search for a climber by name and **add them as a setter**.
5. To **remove a setter**, tap the **garbage can icon** next to their name.

## Admin Permission

Setters can have **admin permissions**, which allow them to:
- **Edit gym info**
- **Add or remove setters**

---

## Setter Limits

By default, homewalls have a **limit of 2 setters** to prevent abuse.

To increase your setter limit:
- **Email us** at [contact@cruxapp.ca](mailto:contact@cruxapp.ca) to raise the limit to **5 setters**.
- **Support Crux on Patreon** for **10 or unlimited setters** (depending on the tier). Learn more on [our Patreon page](https://www.patreon.com/crux_climbing_app).
