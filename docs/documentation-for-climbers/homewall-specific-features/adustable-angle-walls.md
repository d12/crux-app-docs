# Adjustable angle walls for homewalls

:::warning
**This feature is only available for our supporters on Patreon**. [Click here to learn more about our Patreon.](https://www.patreon.com/crux_climbing_app)
:::

The adjustable angle feature allows you to associate a board angle with each wall in your homewall. This lets you easily search and sort for climbs based on the angle of the wall they are on.

## Enabling the feature

This feature currently needs to be enabled manually by Crux staff. To get started, send us an email at [contact@cruxapp.ca](mailto:contact@cruxapp.ca) with the following information:

- Your gym name
- The minimum and maximum angles of your adjustable wall
- The increments you want to allow (e.g. 5°, 10°)
- What angle you'd like us to use for any existing climbs on the wall.

## Assigning an angle to a climb

When setting a climb, you'll be required to select an angle from a list.

## Browsing for climbs with adjustable angles

In the primary climb library, climbs will now have an angle beside their name to make it easy to see which climbs are on which angle wall.

Additionally, you can sort and filter by angle in the filter menu. You can open the filter menu by clicking the filter icon beside the search bar at the top of the climb library.
