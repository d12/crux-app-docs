# Adjustable Angle Walls for Homewalls

:::warning
**This feature is only available for our supporters on Patreon.**
[Click here to learn more about our Patreon.](https://www.patreon.com/crux_climbing_app)
:::

The **adjustable angle** feature allows you to **assign a board angle** to each climb in your homewall. This makes it easier to **search, sort, and browse climbs** based on their angle.

---

## Enabling the Feature

Currently, this feature must be **enabled manually by Crux staff**.

To get started, send an email to [contact@cruxapp.ca](mailto:contact@cruxapp.ca) with the following details:
- **Your gym name**
- **The minimum and maximum angles** of your adjustable wall
- **The increments** you want to allow (e.g., 5°, 10°)
- **The default angle** for any existing climbs on the wall

## Assigning an Angle to a Climb

When setting a climb, you'll be required to **select an angle** from a list.

## Browsing Climbs by Angle

In the **climb library**, each climb will display its assigned **angle** beside its name.

### Filtering by Angle
You can **sort and filter climbs by angle** in the filter menu:
1. Tap the **filter icon** next to the search bar.
2. Select your desired **angle range** to refine your search.
