# Leaderboards

Crux features **friendly gym leaderboards** to help climbers track progress and compete with friends. There are two types of leaderboards:

- **Climber Leaderboard** – Ranks climbers by the number of climbs they’ve sent.
- **Setter Leaderboard** – Ranks climbers by the number of climbs they’ve set.

:::info
Leaderboards track the last **30 days** of activity.
