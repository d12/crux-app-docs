# Leaderboards

Crux offers friendly gym leaderboards to help climbers track their progress and compete with friends. There is a climber leaderboard which shows the climbers with the most sends, and a setter leaderboard which shows the climbers with the most routes set.

Both leaderboards track the last 30 days of activity on Crux.
