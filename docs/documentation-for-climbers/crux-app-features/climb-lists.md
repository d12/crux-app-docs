# Climb Lists

Climb lists allow you to **group climbs together** for organization. You can use them to:
- Track **climbs you want to try**
- Assign climbs to **students or training groups**
- Create **benchmark lists** for your gym

---

## List Privacy

Climb lists can be **private** or **public**.

### Private Lists

- **Only you can see private lists.**
- By default, you start with two private lists:
  - **My Likes** â€“ Climbs you've liked.
  - **My Projects** â€“ Climbs you're working on.
- You can create additional private lists as needed.

### Public Lists

- **Visible to other climbers**, but only the list creator can add to them.
- Useful for sharing climbs with friends or gym members.
- Examples:
  - **"Dom's Favorites"** â€“ A personal list of favorite climbs.
  - **"Climbs for the February Comp"** â€“ A competition set list.

1. Open the **climb page** for the climb you want to add.
2. Tap the **"Climb Lists"** button in the bottom right of the climb image.
3. Select the list you want to add the climb to.

## Viewing Climbs in a List

To view climbs in a specific list:
1. Go to the **Climb Lists** page.
2. Tap **"Show"** next to the list you want to view.

This will open a **climb directory** showing all climbs in that list. You can **search, sort, and filter** climbs just like in the main climb directory.

## Features for Commercial Gym Staff

When creating **public climb lists** at a commercial gym, gym staff have additional options:

### List Owned by the Gym

- Selecting **"This list is owned by the gym"** changes the list ownership from your personal account to the gymâ€™s name.
- Example: Instead of saying **"Owned by Jake Smith,"** it would say **"Owned by Brimstone Climbing Gym."**
- Use this for **official gym lists**, like **"Climbs for the February Comp."**

### Adding a Badge to Climbs in a List

- Selecting **"Add a badge to climbs in this list"** adds a **small list icon** next to each climb in the directory.
- This makes it easy to **spot climbs in a special category**, like gym benchmarks.
- Example: [Pursuit Climbing](https://www.pursuitclimbing.com/) uses this feature for their **"Pursuit Benchmarks"** list.
