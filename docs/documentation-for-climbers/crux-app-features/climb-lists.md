# Climb lists

Climb lists allow you to group climbs together for organization. For example, you could create lists for climbs you want to try, climbs you're assigning to some students, or benchmarks for the gym.

## List privacy

Climb lists can either be public or private.

### Private lists

Private lists can not be seen by other climbers. By default, you'll start out with two private lists, **My likes** and **My projects**. You can create more private lists as needed.

### Public lists

Public lists can be viewed by other climbers but can only be added to by the list's creator. This is useful for sharing lists of climbs with your friends or gym members. For example, "Dom's Favorites" or "Climbs for the February Comp".

## Creating a list

To create a list, navigate to the climb lists page by clicking "Climb lists" on the gym page. Then click the "New list" button in the top right of the page. This will open the new list dialog.

## Adding climbs to a list

To add a climb to a list, navigate to the climb you want to add and click the "climb lists" button in the bottom right of the climb image. From there, you can add the climb to any lists that you have access to. Note that you cannot add to public lists unless you are the list's creator or gym staff.

You can also use this menu to remove climbs from climb lists.

## Viewing the climbs in a list

To see the climbs in a list, head to the climb lists page and click on the "Show" button beside the list you'd like to view. This will bring you to a climb directory of all the climbs in the specific list.

From this page, you'll be able to search, sort, and filter climbs like you can with the usual climbs directory.

## Features for commercial gym staff

When creating **public** climb lists at a commercial climbing gym, gym staff have a couple of extra features:

### List is owned by the gym

When you select "This list is owned by the gym", the list will be labeled as being created by your (your gym name) instead of (your name). For example, instead of saying "Owned by Jake Smith", it would say "Owned by Brimstone Climbing Gym". This should be used for official gym lists, such as "Climbs for the February Comp".

### Add a badge to climbs in this list

When you select "Add a badge to climbs in this list", all climbs in the list will have a badge added to them in the climb directory. This badge will be a small version of the climb list icon.

Gyms typically use this to add badges to their benchmark climbs. For example, [Pursuit Climbing](https://www.pursuitclimbing.com/) has a "Pursuit Benchmarks" list that they add a badge to. This makes it easy for climbers to see at a glance which climbs are benchmarks.
