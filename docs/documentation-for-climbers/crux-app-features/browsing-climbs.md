# Browsing climbs

To view climbs on Crux, click the "Climbs" button on the main gym page. This will take you to the directory of all active climbs at your gym. From here, you can scroll down to view the climbs in the gym. By default, climbs are sorted by the date they were set on.

## Searching by name or setter

To search for climbs by climb name or by setter name, you can use the search bar at the top of the climb directory. When a search term is entered, the climb directory will filter to only show climbs that match the search term. For a climb to match the search term, the climb name OR the setter name must contain the search term.

## The sort and filter menu

To further refine the climbs you're viewing, you can use the sort and filter menu. This menu is accessible by clicking the "filter" button beside the search bar. After selecting your filter and sort options, click "Search" at the bottom of the menu to apply your changes.

### Sorting

You can sort by the following options:

- **Area**: Sorts climbs by the area they are set in. (Only applies to gyms with areas)
- **Set date**: Sorts climbs by the date they were set, with the most recent climbs first.
- **Grade**: Sorts climbs by grade, with the easiest climbs first.
- **Rating**: Sorts climbs by the rating, with the highest-rated climbs first.
- **Sends**: Sorts climbs by the number of times they've been sent, with the most-sent climbs first.

### Filtering

You can filter by the following options:

- **Sent status**: Filter for climbs that you've sent, haven't sent, or both.
- **Active status**: Filter for climbs that are active, inactive (unset), or both.
- **Climbs with beta videos**: Enable to only show climbs that have beta videos attached.
- **Area**: If your gym has areas enabled, you can filter by area.
- **Grade**: Filter for climbs that are a specific grade or within a grade range.
- **Tags**: Filter for climbs that have specific tags.

### Saving your filter settings

If you find yourself using the same filter settings often, you can save your filter settings by clicking the "Set as default" button at the top right of the filter menu. This will save your filter settings for the next time you visit the climb directory.

## Swiping between climbs

To make it easier to scroll through climbs, you can swipe left or right from the climb page to navigate to the next or previous climb. This only works on the climb page, not the climb directory page.
