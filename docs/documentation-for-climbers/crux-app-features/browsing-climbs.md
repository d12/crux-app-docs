# Browsing Climbs

## Viewing Climbs at Your Gym

To browse climbs in Crux, tap the **"Climbs"** button on the main gym page. This opens the **climb directory**, where you can scroll through all active climbs at your gym.

By default, climbs are **sorted by date**, with the most recently set climbs appearing first.

---

## Searching by Name or Setter

To **search for a climb**:
1. Use the **search bar** at the top of the climb directory.
2. Enter a **climb name** or **setter name**.
3. The directory will automatically filter to show only matching results.

A climb **matches** if either the climb name OR setter name contains your search term.

## Using the Sort & Filter Menu

To **refine your search**, use the **sort and filter** menu:
- Tap the **"Filter"** button next to the search bar.
- Choose your desired **sort and filter options**.
- Tap **"Search"** to apply your selections.
