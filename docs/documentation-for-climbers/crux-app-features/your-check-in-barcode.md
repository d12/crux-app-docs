# Your check-in barcode

Crux provides you with a barcode that you can use to sign in at your gym. This barcode is unique to you and is linked to your Crux account.

## Accessing the barcode

From the main gym page, click the barcode button in the top left of the screen to access the barcode.

## Setting up your barcode

You'll need your gym front desk to set up the barcode before you can use it to sign in. To set up the code, let the front desk know you'd like to update your barcode and show them the Crux barcode on your phone.
