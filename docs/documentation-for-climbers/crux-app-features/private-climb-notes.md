# Private Climb Notes

Private climb notes work like regular [climb comments](/docs/documentation-for-climbers/crux-app-features/sharing-photos-and-beta-videos.md), but **only you can see them**.

Use private notes to:
- Track **beta** for a climb
- Log your **progress** and attempts
- Save any other details you want to remember

## How to Add a Private Note

1. Navigate to the **climb page**.
2. Tap the **"Add private note"** button.
3. Type your note in the text box.
4. Tap **"Save"** to store your note.
