# Private climb notes

Private climb notes are like regular [climb comments](/docs/documentation-for-climbers/crux-app-features/sharing-photos-and-beta-videos.md), but they are only visible to you. Use private notes to keep track of beta, progress, or other information you want to remember about a climb.

To add a private note to a climb, navigate to the climb's page and click the "Add private note" button. Type your note in the text box that appears and click "Save."
