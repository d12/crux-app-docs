# Gym activity feed

The gym activity feed is right below the navigation buttons on the gym page. The feed shows the most recent activity in the gym, including announcements, new beta videos, and more.

The following activities are displayed in the feed:

- **Gym announcements**: Gym staff can post announcements to the gym feed. Announcements can be used to inform climbers about upcoming events, changes in gym hours, and more.
- **Crux announcements**: Occasionally, the Crux team will post announcements globally to announce new features or important news. These will show in the gym feed.
- **New beta videos or climb comments**: When a new beta video or comment is uploaded to a climb, it will show in the feed.
- **Milestones**: When a climb reaches a send or like milestone (10 likes, for example), it will show in the feed.
- **Climber posts**: Climbers can post to the gym feed to ask questions or start discussions. To post to the feed, use the comment box directly above the activity feed.

## Pinned items

Gym staff can pin any item in the feed to the top. This is a great way to ensure people see important news or updates. To pin an item, click the "..." in the top right of the item and select "Pin to top." Pinned items will stay at the top of the feed until unpinned.
