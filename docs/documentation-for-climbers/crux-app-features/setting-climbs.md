# Setting Climbs

## How Crux Differs from Other Apps

Most climbing apps use a **single static photo** of a wall or gym where you select holds to create climbs.

Crux is **more flexible**—you can **take or upload a new photo for each climb**. This means:
- If the holds change or you want to set on a new section of the wall, just take a fresh photo.
- There’s **no extra charge or limit** on the number of photos you can upload.

To save time, you can also **re-use previously uploaded photos**. More on that below!

## How to Set a Climb

1. **Open the Climbs directory** – Tap **"Climbs"** on the main gym page.
2. **Tap "Add climb"** – This opens the new climb setup.
3. **Choose a photo** – Take a new photo, upload an image, or select a previously used one.
4. **Edit the image** – Select holds, crop, draw, and add circuit markers. Tap the checkmark when done.
5. **Enter climb details** – Add a name, grade, and any relevant details.
6. **Tap "Post climb"** – Your climb is now live for others to try. Nice work!

The next sections break down these features in more detail.

## Re-Using Photos

Crux **automatically saves your uploaded photos** to the gym’s photo library. This makes it easy to reuse recent images instead of taking new ones each time.

### Selecting a Recently Used Photo
1. On the image selection screen, tap **"Or, use a photo from a recent climb."**
2. Select a photo from the **recent library** to open it in the image editor.

<img src="/img/uploading-a-recent-photo.png" alt="Selecting a recently used photo for your climb" class="screenshot" />

### Pinning Frequently Used Photos
If you regularly use the same images (e.g., a photo of a **spray wall**), you can **pin** them to the top of the list:
1. Tap the **three dots** in the top-right of the photo.
2. Select **"Pin photo"** to keep it at the top of your library.

## Editing Your Image

### Scanning for Holds
1. Tap the **wand icon** in the top-right corner of the image editor.
2. Crux will scan the image for holds (takes ~5 seconds).
3. When scanning is complete, an animation will show detected holds. Tap to select them!

:::tip
**Hold positions are saved** for each photo, so you won’t need to rescan if you reuse the image later.
:::

:::warning
If holds aren’t detected correctly, make sure the image is **well-lit, clear, and taken at a straight angle**.
:::

### Creating Circuits
1. Select holds for your climb.
2. Tap the **circuit icon**.
3. Tap the holds in the order you’d like them numbered.

### Drawing on the Image
Use the **pencil icon** to mark beta, cross out off-limits holds, or indicate start positions.

### Cropping the Image
Tap the **crop tool**, adjust the crop box, and confirm with the checkmark button.

### Adjusting Image Style
Crux lets you adjust visual settings (line thickness, image darkness, etc.):
1. Tap the **settings cog** in the image editor.
2. Adjust settings to customize the look of your climb.
3. **Gym admins** can set default styles for all future climbs by tapping **"Set gym defaults."**

## Proposed Grade

When you post a climb, you can:
- Set a **proposed grade**
- Leave it **ungraded** and let climbers vote

The grade will automatically adjust as more climbers vote.

:::warning
Gym admins can **disable grade voting** in settings. If disabled, setter-proposed grades are final.

## Feet Rules

Feet rules define which holds can be used as footholds:
- **Feet Follow Hands** – Any marked hold can be used for feet.
- **Feet Follow Hands, Open Kicker** – Same as above, plus **all holds on the kickboard are allowed**.
- **Only Marked Feet** – Only green-marked holds can be used for feet.
- **Campus (No Feet)** – No footholds allowed.
- **Any Feet** – Any hold on the wall can be used for feet.

## Tags

Tags make climbs easier to find! For example, if a climb is **slopey**, tag it as **"Slopey"** so others can filter for similar climbs.
