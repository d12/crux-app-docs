# Setting climbs

## How Crux differs from other apps

In most other climbing apps, you have a single photo for your wall or gym that you can set climbs on, and when you go to set a climb, you choose the holds on the single image. Since Crux was built to be more flexible than that, our setting process differs sligthly.

In Crux, we allow you to select or take a photo for each climb. This means that if your holds change, or if you want to set a climb on a new area of the wall, you can just take a photo and upload it to Crux. There's no additional charge or fee for additional photos.

Obviously needing to take a photo every time you set a climb would be tedious, so we allow you to re-use previously uploaded photos as well. More about this in the following sections :)

## How to set a climb

1. Navigate to the Climbs directory by clicking the "Climbs" button on the main gym page.
2. Click the "Add climb" button in the bottom right to open the new climb drawer.
3. Select a photo. You can either take a photo with your camera, upload a photo, or use a previously uploaded photo.
4. Edit your image. This is where you can select holds, crop the image, draw on the image, add circuit markers, and more. When you're done, click the checkmark button at the bottom of the screen.
5. Fill out the remaining climb details. This includes the name, grade, and more.
6. Click "Post climb" to save your climb to the gym. Your climb is now visible for all to try, nice work!

The following sections dive into different parts of this process at greater detail.

### Re-using photos

After you've used a photo for a climb once, we'll automatically save it in your gym's photo library. This is a library of photos recently used for climbs at the gym.

To select a photo from this "recent library", click on "Or, use a photo from a recent climb" below the image upload buttons. This will open a screen with all the photos that have been recently used at the gym. Select one to open the image editor and start selecting holds.

### Organizing your recently used climb photos

If you have a few photos you commonly use (perhaps a photo of each of two spray walls), you can pin these to the top of the recent library. To do this, click the three dots in the top right of the photo and select "Pin photo". The photo will now remain at the top of the list.

### Editing your image

#### Scanning for holds

To scan for holds, click the wand icon in the top right of the image editor. This will upload the photo to our image scanner and should take less than 5 seconds. If you find it's taking longer than this, please ensure you're connected to wifi.

After the scan is done, you'll see the loading dialog dissapear and an animation play that shows the discovered holds. You can now tap on holds to select them!

:::tip
We save the hold positions for each photo, so if you select a recently used photo, you won't need to wait for another scan.

:::warning
If you find that some holds are not scanned correctly, please ensure your image is well lit, clear, and taken at a straight angle.

#### Creating circuits

To create a circuit (a climb with numbered holds), ensure you have some selected holds and then click the circuit icon. From there, just start tapping on holds in the order that you'd like them to be labelled in your circuit.

#### Drawing on the image

To draw on the image, click the pencil icon. The draw tool is commonly used to cross out edges that are off, to indicate the number of starting hands/feet, or to circle missed holds.

#### Cropping the image

To crop the image, select the crop tool and drag the corners of the crop box to the desired size. When you're done, click the checkmark button at the bottom of the screen. Only the cropped section of the image will be used for the climb.

#### Image style

Crux images have a default "look and feel" that includes the line thickness, image darkness, and more. Most of these visual effects are configurable by clicking on the settings cog button. From there, you can edit the visual settings to make your climb images look the way you like. If you're the gym admin, you can persist these settings as default for all future climbs by clicking the "Set gym defaults" button.

### Proposed grade

When you set a climb, you can leave it ungraded or set a proposed grade. As other climbers try the climb, they can vote on the grade they think it should be. As votes come in, the grade will change to reflect the average of the votes.

This behavior can be disabled by the gym admin in the gym settings. When disabled, the setter-proposed grade is always final.

### Feet rules

The feet rules dropdown indicates the rules for feet on the climb. The following options are available:

- **Feet follow hands**: Any marked hold (regardless of it's label) can be used as feet.
- **Feet follow hands, open kicker**: The same as above, with the addition that all feet on the kickboard are in.
- **Only marked feet**: Only feet marked in green are allowed. Holds marked in white are for hands and cannot be used for feet.
- **Campus (no feet)**: No feet are allowed on this climb.
- **Any feet**: Any hold on the wall can be used as feet. The outlined holds only reflect the allowed hand holds.

### Tags

Tags can be selected to help make climbs more discoverable. For example, if you have a climb that's slopey, you could tag it with "Slopey" so that climbers can find your climb by filtering for the "Slopey" tag.
