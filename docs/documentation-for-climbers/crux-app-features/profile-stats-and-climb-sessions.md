# Profile, stats, and climb sessions

As you use Crux over time, your profile will become a home for useful information about your climbing habits and progress. This page will help you understand what you can find in your profile. To access your profile, click on the profile icon in the bottom right of the screen.

## Privacy

Your climber profile is public by default, but it can be optionally hidden from other climbers. To hide your profile, click the settings button in the top right of your profile, then click "Privacy settings". Here you can toggle your profile to be hidden or visible.

## Stats tab

The main tab of the profile is the stats page. Here, there are three main graphs.

- The first graph "All-time sent climbs" shows the number of climbs you've sent for each grade, as well as the ratio of flashes to non-flashes. This graph is a fun representation of the grades you tend to climb.
- The second graph "Climbing styles" shows the styles of climbs that you tend to send. This graph is useful for understanding your strengths and weaknesses.
- The last graphs "Monthly trends by grade" shows how many of each grade you've sent in the last month, and compares this to the month before. This graph is helpful for understanding if you're progressing.

## Sessions tab

The second tab is the climb sessions tab. Here, you can deep-dive into each climbing session and see what you worked on during each session. You can also see your trends month-by-month on the calendar. Each colored square represents a session, and the color represents the highest grade you sent during that session.

If you click a date on the calendar, it'll bring you to the session view where you can see:
- The climbs you sent that day
- The climbs you attempted that day
- Any private session notes that you recorded.

Session notes can be logged at any time by going to a session and clicking the "+" beside the "My private notes" header.

## Set climbs tab

The set climbs tab shows an overview of all the climbs you've set while using Crux.

## Gallery tab

The gallery tab shows all of the photos and videos that you've uploaded to Crux. Items with a white "lock" icon are private and can only be seen by you. These are media items that were uploaded to private comments.
