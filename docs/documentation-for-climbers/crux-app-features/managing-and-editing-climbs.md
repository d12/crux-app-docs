# Managing and editing climbs

:::note
Note that only gym staff and the author of a climb may edit a climb.
:::

This guide will walk you through the process of managing and editing climbs on Crux.

## Editing climbs

To edit a climb, click the "..." in the top right of the climb, and then click "Edit climb".

From there, you can edit the climb's attributes or image.

### Editing the climb image

If you need to update the selected holds on an image, you can click the pencil icon on the climb image in the edit drawer. This will open the image editor where you can update the selected holds.

If you need to replace the image entirely (for example, if you need to take a wider or higher quality photo), click the X in the top right of the photo in the edit drawer, then re-upload a new photo.

## Unsetting a climb

To unset a climb, click the "..." in the top right of the climb, and then click "Mark as unset". This will remove the climb from the climb directory unless you have the "Show unset climbs" filter enabled.

:::info
Note that we do not delete climbs from the system when you unset them. This is to allow climbers to see old climbs they've sent in their session history.
