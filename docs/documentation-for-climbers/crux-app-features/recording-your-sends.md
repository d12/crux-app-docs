# Recording your sends

Recording your climb sends on Crux allows you to see your progress over time and browse through previous climbing sessions on your profile page.

## How to mark sends

To mark a send, head to a climb page and click "Mark as sent" at the bottom. This will open the send dialog, where you can specify the number of attempts, when you sent the climb, a suggested grade, and a rating.

### Suggested grades

You can optionally suggest a grade when marking a climb as sent. To ensure climbs are graded fairly, we'll adjust the climb grade to match the climber consensus over time.

## Marking repeats

After marking your first send on a climb, the "Mark as sent" button is replaced with a purple "Log repeat" button. You can use this button to log additional sends on the climb.
