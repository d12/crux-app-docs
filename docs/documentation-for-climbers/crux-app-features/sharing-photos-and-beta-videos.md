1. Open the climb you want to share a photo or beta video for
2. Scroll down to the comments section
3. Click the blue "New comment" button in the bottom right.
4. Fill out the comment form.

## Discovering photos and beta videos

Photos and beta videos are displayed in the comments section of each climb. You can scroll through the comments to see all the photos and videos that have been shared for that climb.

Photos and videos are also surfaced in the [activity feed](/docs/documentation-for-climbers/crux-app-features/activity-feed.md) for the gym. This makes it easy to scroll through all the latest content that has been shared at your gym!

## Managing your comments

You can delete your comments at any time. To do this, click the "..." in the top right of your comment and select "Delete".
