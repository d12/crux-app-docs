# Webhooks

Crux can emit webhooks for certain events. This allows you to develop integrations with Crux that are notified when certain events occur.

## Webhook Types

We have two types of webhook types, `user` and `gym` webhooks.

User webhooks pertain to your own user and are triggered when you do different things on Crux. You can only register user webhooks for yourself.

Gym webhooks pertain to a specific gym and can be triggered by anyone at the gym. You can only register gym webhooks if you are a gym admin.

## Registering a webhook

To register a user webhook, head to the user settings and tap `User webhooks`. To register a gym webhook, head to the gym settings and tap `Gym webhooks`.

Webhooks must be registered with a publically accessible http or https endpoint.

## Webhook Delivery

Webhook events are delivered via POST request to the URL you provided. The body of the request will be a JSON object containing the event data.

You must return a HTTP 200 response to acknowledge receipt of the webhook. If you do not respond, the delivery will be retried up to 3 times before failing.

## Delivery Introspection

We do not currently have a UI to view details about webhook deliveries. You can view details about recent delivery attempts via the [webhook_registrations](/docs/api-documentation/api-reference.md) APIs however.
