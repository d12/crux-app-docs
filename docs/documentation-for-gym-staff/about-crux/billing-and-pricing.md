# Billing and pricing

## Billing structure

Crux is billed as a subscription service. We bill month-by-month with no commitment. This means you're welcome to give Crux a go for a period of time and cancel at any time. We bill the gym directly, and there is no fee for your climbers.

## What's included?

The Crux subscription includes:
- The full version of Crux for all of your climbers
- Unlimited climbers, climbs, and resets
- Unlimited gym staff
- Priority email support and feature requests
- Marketing materials like stickers and posters via mail

## Pricing

Crux is priced differently in different regions, but is generally less than a single climber's monthly dues. Please reach out to us at [contact@cruxapp.ca](contact@cruxapp.ca) to learn more about pricing.
