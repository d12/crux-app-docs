# Why Adopt Crux at Your Gym?

## Crux Turns Setting into an Accessible Community Activity

Many newer climbers avoid **spray walls** because they feel confusing, the holds are challenging, and the walls are often steep.

Crux makes **setting accessible** by allowing climbers to set **anywhere in the gym**, not just on spray walls. This means:
- Climbers can **set on walls they feel comfortable climbing on**.
- Climbers can **create problems appropriate for their level**.

## Crux Is the Most User-Friendly Climbing App

Crux is **rated 4.9 stars** on both the iOS App Store and Google Play Store—higher than any other indoor climbing app.

This is because **we designed Crux for real climbers**. We worked with **gym staff, setters, and climbers of all levels** to create an app that is:
- **Easy to use**
- **Intuitive**
- **Fun**

### Setting a Climb Is as Easy as 1-2-3:
1. **Take a photo** of the wall.
2. **Tap on the holds** you want to use.

### Community = Member Retention

The **Climbing Wall Association** cites **community** as the **#1 way to retain members** in gyms. From their article ["6 Ways to Retain Your Members](https://www.cwapro.org/blog/6-ways-to-retain-your-members):

> There isn’t just one magic incentive or trick you can use to retain membership. “It has be a core value that is applied across all aspects of the gym’s facilities, operations, services, etc.” says Rich Breuner, Director of Operations at Bend Rock Gym.
>
> The gym’s #1 goal, he says, is to support and facilitate an amazing community experience. “That translates to people wanting to become and stay members,” he explains.
>
> It’s working. BRG has seen member attrition rates drop significantly since 2016, when they began examining programs gym-wide and implementing adjustments with member retention in mind.

Crux helps **facilitate an amazing community experience**, making climbers **more likely to become and stay members**.

## Crux Is the Most Hands-Off Climbing App

### No More Outdated Climbing Apps

A **common complaint** from board climbers is that their **spray wall app is often out-of-date**.

### How Crux Fixes This:
- Climbers **take their own photos** and **scan them instantly**.
- No work is required by gym staff.
- The app is **always up to date** with the latest climbs.

This **frees up your staff** to focus on **running your gym**, while Crux keeps serving your community.

### Use push notifications to:
- Announce **sales, events, and new sets**.
- Send **surveys and ask for feedback**.
- Communicate with your community **in a more personal way**.

Unlike **emails (which go to spam)** and **social media (which gets lost in the noise)**, **push notifications are a direct and effective way** to reach your climbers.
