# Why adopt Crux at your gym?

## Crux turns setting into an accessible community activity

Newer climbers tend to avoid spray walls because they're confusing, the holds are small, and the walls are often steep. Crux makes setting into an accessible community activity by allowing climbers to set **anywhere in the gym**, not just on the spray walls. This means that climbers can set on walls that they're comfortable climbing on, and that they can set problems that are appropriate for their climbing level.

## Crux is the most user-friendly climbing app

Crux is rated 4.9 stars on both the iOS App Store and the Google Play Store, higher than any other indoor climbing app. This is because we've designed Crux from the ground-up with real climbers in mind. We've worked with gym staff, setters, and climbers of all levels to build an app that's easy to use, intuitive, and fun.

Setting is an easy 3-step process that anyone can do without technical expertise or prior climbing experience:

1. Take a photo of the wall you want to set on.
2. Tap on the holds you want to use.
3. Save the climb to the gym.

## Crux builds a tight-knit community

Climbing is a social sport, and Crux is designed to bring climbers together. Climbers looking for a new challenge can scroll through a directory of community-set climbs. Climbers can post comments, share beta, and give feedback on each other's climbs. We also offer friendly leaderboards to foster engagement and competition.

In [CWA's "6 Ways To Retain Your Members"](https://www.cwapro.org/blog/6-ways-to-retain-your-members), the author cites "Building a community" as the #1 way to retain members.

> There isn’t just one magic incentive or trick you can use to retain membership. “It has be a core value that is applied across all aspects of the gym’s facilities, operations, services, etc.” says Rich Breuner, Director of Operations at Bend Rock Gym. The gym’s #1 goal, he says, is to support and facilitate an amazing community experience. “That translates to people wanting to become and stay members,” he explains. It’s working. BRG has seen member attrition rates drop significantly since 2016, when they began examining programs gym-wide and implementing adjustments with member retention in mind.

Crux is the perfect tool to help you build a tight-knit community at your gym.

## Crux is the most hands-off climbing app

The #1 complaint we hear from board climbers is that their spray wall app is often out-of-date. This happens because most apps require gym staff to go through painful or expensive processes to update the wall on their app.

Since Crux allows climbers to take their own photos and scan them instantly, there is 0 work required by the gym or staff to update the app. The app will always be up-to-date, available, and serving your community, leaving you to focus on what you do best: running your gym.

## Crux offers a unique communication channel

Crux is the only climbing app that allows gym staff to send free-form push notifications to climbers. You can use this feature to announce sales, events, or new sets. You can also use this feature to send out surveys, ask for feedback, or communicate with your community in a more personal way.

Since emails go to spam and social media posts get lost in the noise, push notifications can be the most effective way to get your message infront of your climbers.

## Crux helps with operating competitive teams

As part of running a comp team, coaches often set challenge problems on a spray or regular climbing wall for the students. We've seen teams use tape, photos with marker, or just memorization to try to keep track of these problems.

Crux makes this process easy by allowing coaches to set problems in the app, organize them into a list of comp climbs, and share the list with your team. This makes it easy for coaches to assign problems to students and makes it easy for climbers to remember climbs and track the ones they've finished.
