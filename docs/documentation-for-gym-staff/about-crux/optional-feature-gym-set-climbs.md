# (Optional Feature) Gym-Set Climbs

:::info
This feature is **not enabled by default**. To enable it, please contact Crux at [nat@cruxapp.ca](mailto:nat@cruxapp.ca).
:::

Crux offers an optional feature for gyms to **manage official gym-set climbs**.

This allows gyms to:
- Keep **track of set climbs**.
- Let climbers **browse official climbs, mark sends, and track progress**.
- Boost climber **engagement and motivation**.

## How It Works

When **gym-set climbs** are enabled, your **gym’s climb directory** will have **two tabs**:
- **Custom Climbs** – Climbs set by your community.
- **Official Climbs** – Climbs set by gym staff.

### Setting Official Climbs
- The **setting interface is streamlined** for quick entry.
- **Only gym staff** can set official climbs.

---

## New-Set Notifications

Each time you **post a new set** in Crux, climbers will **automatically receive a push notification**.

This allows climbers to:
- **See what’s new** before arriving at the gym.
- **Plan their session** in advance.
- **Get excited** to try fresh climbs!

---

## Annotating Climb Images

For **custom climbs**, climbers highlight each hold in the **image editor**.

For **official gym-set climbs**, annotation is **optional** since:
- Climbs follow a **single color**.
- You can **specify the hold color** instead of marking holds manually.

Climbers can **filter official climbs** by:
- **Gym area**
- **Difficulty**
- **Hold color**

## Gym Analytics

Enabling **official climbs** gives your gym access to **detailed analytics** about climber activity and set performance.

### Insights Include:
- **Which climbs are popular or underused**.
- **Which climbs may be misgraded** based on user feedback.
- **How new sets compare to past sets**.

The **analytics dashboard** provides a range of **graphs and insights** to help gyms optimize their setting.

### Tracking Climb Performance

The **Climbs Tab** shows a list of **all climbs set at your gym**.

You can:
- **Sort and filter climbs** by popularity or activity.
- **Identify climbs that may be misgraded**.
