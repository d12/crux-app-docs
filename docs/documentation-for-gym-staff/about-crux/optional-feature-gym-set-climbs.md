# (Optional feature) Gym-set climbs

:::info
This feature is not enabled by default. Please contact Crux by email at [nat@cruxapp.ca](mailto:nat@cruxapp.ca) to enable this feature.
:::

We offer an optional feature to our gym partners that allows them to manage their official gym-set climbs on Crux. This feature allows gyms to keep tabs on what's set at the gym, and lets climbers use Crux to see what's set at the gym, mark what they've finished, and gain insights into their activity at your gym. This helps keep climbers engaged and motivated to climb.

## How it works

When gym-set climbs are enabled at your gym, there will be a second tab of climbs on your main page, one for custom climbs and one for official climbs. Your gym-set climbs will go in the official climbs section.

The interface for setting official climbs is similar, but is streamlined to make it easy to post a large number of climbs all at once. Only your gym staff can set official climbs.

## New-set Notifications

When you post a new set on Crux, your climbers will automatically be sent a push notification letting them know a new set is up. They can use the Crux app to see what's new, plan their session, and get excited to come in and try the new climbs!

## Annotating climb images

Typically when customs are set on Crux, climbers will highlight each hold in the image editor. This is optional for gym-set climbs since climbs follow a single color, and you can specify the hold color when setting the climb. Climbers can easily search for climbs by the area of the gym, the difficulty, and the hold colors.

## Gym analytics

When you enable official climbs, you get access to in-depth analytics about how climbers are interacting with your gym and climbs. The analytics dashboard can be used to learn what climbs are popular and unpopular, which climbs are misgraded, and how your sets compare to previous sets.

The dashboard page includes a number of useful graphs to learn more about what climbers are doing at your gym. It also includes a "Most recent set" section which compares your latest set with previous sets.

The climbs tab shows a list of all the climbs set at your gym. You can sort and filter gyms by popularity or activity, and you can see which climbs are possibly misgraded.
