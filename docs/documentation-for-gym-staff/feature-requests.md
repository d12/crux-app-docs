# Feature requests

Crux is actively developed, and our commercial gym partners have first priority when it comes to feature requests. This means that if you find Crux is missing something important, we may be able to have it added to the app within a week or two.

## How to request a feature

Please contact Nat at [nat@cruxapp.ca](mailto:nat@cruxapp.ca) with your feature request. If you have any specific details or examples, please include them in your email.
