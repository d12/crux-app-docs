# Getting Your Gym Started with Crux

Welcome to Crux! We're excited to have you on board. This guide will help you **get started** and make the most of the platform.

---

## Setting Up Your Gym

### Setting Up Payment

Your contact at Crux will assist you with adding your **payment method**.

### Setting Up Your Gym

This step is handled by the **Crux team**. If you haven't already, please fill out the [onboarding form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfGkpQTSZSxq_EkcjB22kqrXb_3uxENddPGh3s8woO9ytM61g/viewform?usp=sf_link) so we can set up your gym according to your preferences.

### Installing the Crux App

Follow the instructions [here](/docs/documentation-for-climbers/getting-started/downloading-crux-and-signing-in.md) to install Crux on your phone. **Let Nat know when you've installed the app and logged in so he can add you as an admin**.

### Adding Your Staff

:::info
Staff members **must download and sign in to Crux** before you can add them to your gym.
:::

Once your gym is set up and the first admin is added, you can start **adding staff**:
1. Open your **gym page** and tap the **settings cog**.
2. Select **"Staff Members"**.
3. Enter a **staff member’s name** to add them.

Staff have access to **moderation tools**, and if you enable **admin permissions**, they can also **manage gym settings**.

### Posting Initial Climbs

Before announcing Crux to your climbers, it’s helpful to have some climbs set. This helps new users **understand Crux’s purpose** when they first install the app.

To add climbs:
1. Open your **gym page** and tap the **"Climbs"** tab.
2. Tap the **blue "Add Climb"** button.
3. Follow the setup instructions.

If you have a **spray wall**, we recommend setting at least:
- **One spray climb**
- **One regular wall climb**

### Pinning a Spray Wall Photo

Climbers can **select an existing wall image** when setting a climb instead of taking a new photo. To simplify setting, we recommend **pinning a photo of your spray wall**.

Before pinning a photo, make sure you’ve **set at least one climb on your spray wall** so there’s an image available in your recent photos.

To pin a photo:
1. Open the **"Climbs"** tab.
2. Tap **"Add Climb"** in the bottom right.
3. Select **"Or, use a photo from a recent climb."**
4. Tap **"..."** in the top right of the photo you want to pin and select **"Pin Photo"**.

## Announcing Crux to Your Climbers

### Choosing a Launch Date

The **exact date** isn’t critical, but we recommend **selecting a single launch date** to:
- Put up **posters**
- Announce on **social media**

A single launch date **builds excitement** and increases engagement.

### Preparing Social Media Announcements

We recommend **posting on all available channels**, such as:
- **Instagram**
- **Facebook**
- **Email newsletters**

Use your gym’s **usual design language** for branding. We also provide **Crux visual assets** (including logos) here:

### Launch Day Checklist

On the **morning of your launch date**, make sure to:
- **Put up posters**
  - At least one **near the front desk** (so climbers can ask about Crux).
  - One **near the spray wall**, if applicable.
- **Give away stickers** at the front desk (if they’ve arrived).
- **Post on social media** to announce the launch.
