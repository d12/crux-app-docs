# Getting your gym started with Crux

Welcome to Crux! We're excited to have you on board. This guide will help you get started with Crux and make the most of the platform.

## Setting up payment

The first step is to set up your payment method. Your contact at Crux will help you add your payment method.

## Setting up your gym

This step is handled by the Crux team. If you haven't already, be sure to fill out the [onboarding form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfGkpQTSZSxq_EkcjB22kqrXb_3uxENddPGh3s8woO9ytM61g/viewform?usp=sf_link) so the team can set up your gym how you'd like it.

## Adding your staff

:::info
Note that you can only add staff who have downloaded and signed in to Crux. Ensure your staff download the app before trying to add them to your gym

Once your gym is created and we've added a first admin, you can start adding your staff. To do this, click the settings cog at the top of your gym page and then click "Staff members". From here, you can add staff members by entering their name.

Staff will have access to moderation tools, and if you enable the admin permission, they'll also have access to the gym settings.

## Posting some first climbs

It's important to have some climbs set before you announce Crux to your climbers. This helps climbers understand the purpose of Crux when they install the app.

To add some climbs, click the "Climbs" tab on your gym page and then click the blue "Add climb" button in the center. From here, follow the instructions.

If you have a spray wall and also want to encourage climbs set on your usual climbing walls, we recommend setting at least one spray climb and one regular wall climb.

## Pinning your spray wall photo

Climbers have the option to select an existing wall image when setting a climb instead of taking a photo every time. To make setting as easy as possible, we recommend pinning a photo of your spray wall to the top of the recent photos section.

Ensure you have already set a climb on your spray first, otherwise you won't have any photos in your recent photos section.

To pin a photo,

1. Click the "Climbs" tab on your gym page
2. Click the blue "Add climb" button in the bottom right.
3. Click "Or, use a photo from a recent climb"
4. Click the "..." in the top right of the photo you want to pin, and select "Pin photo"

## Launching Crux

Once your gym is all set up, you're ready to spread the news! You can announce Crux to your climbers however you like, but these are the things that we've found help get folks onboard:

1. **Hang posters**: The morning of your first day, hang posters in your gym. There should be a poster near the front desk and one near your spray if you have one. Crux will mail you posters, or you can print them yourself if you prefer.
2. **Put out stickers**: We'll also mail you a bundle of stickers to hand out to climbers. This gets people excited and helps spread the word. You can place these in a pile at the front desk.
3. **Announce on social media**: Post about Crux on your social media channels. We can provide you with some images to use.
