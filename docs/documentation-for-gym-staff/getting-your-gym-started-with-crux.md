# Getting your gym started with Crux

Welcome to Crux! We're excited to have you on board. This guide will help you get started with Crux and make the most of the platform.

## Setting up your gym

#### Setting up payment

The first step is to set up your payment method. Your contact at Crux will help you add your payment method.

#### Setting up your gym

This step is handled by the Crux team. If you haven't already, be sure to fill out the [onboarding form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfGkpQTSZSxq_EkcjB22kqrXb_3uxENddPGh3s8woO9ytM61g/viewform?usp=sf_link) so the team can set up your gym how you'd like it.

#### Install the Crux app

Please follow the instructions [here](/docs/documentation-for-climbers/getting-started/downloading-crux-and-signing-in.md) to install Crux on your phone.

#### Adding your staff

:::info
Note that you can only add staff who have downloaded and signed in to Crux. Ensure your staff download the app before trying to add them to your gym
:::

Once your gym is created and we've added a first admin, you can start adding your staff. To do this, click the settings cog at the top of your gym page and then click "Staff members". From here, you can add staff members by entering their name.

Staff will have access to moderation tools, and if you enable the admin permission, they'll also have access to the gym settings.

#### Posting some first climbs

It's important to have some climbs set before you announce Crux to your climbers. This helps climbers understand the purpose of Crux when they install the app.

To add some climbs, click the "Climbs" tab on your gym page and then click the blue "Add climb" button in the center. From here, follow the instructions.

If you have a spray wall and also want to encourage climbs set on your usual climbing walls, we recommend setting at least one spray climb and one regular wall climb.

#### Pinning your spray wall photo

Climbers have the option to select an existing wall image when setting a climb instead of taking a photo every time. To make setting as easy as possible, we recommend pinning a photo of your spray wall to the top of the recent photos section.

Ensure you have already set a climb on your spray first, otherwise you won't have any photos in your recent photos section.

To pin a photo,

1. Click the "Climbs" tab on your gym page
2. Click the blue "Add climb" button in the bottom right.
3. Click "Or, use a photo from a recent climb"
4. Click the "..." in the top right of the photo you want to pin, and select "Pin photo"

## Announcing Crux to your Climbers

#### Choose a launch date

The specific date isn't important, but we recommend choosing a single date to put up posters and post on socials. This helps build excitement and get climbers onboard.

#### Prepare socials

We highly recommend posting via whatever channels you have available. This usually includes Instagram, Facebook, and sometimes an email newsletter. We recommend using your usual design language for your posts, and we have a directory of visual assets (including logos) you can use here: [Crux Creative Assets](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1Opfo40ceL-2rQ98L8CWc5F4BQouUiLFu)

#### Launch!

On the morning of your launch date:
- Put up posters. At least one should be near the front desk (it encourages climbers to ask front desk staff about Crux) and one should be near the spray wall if you have one.
- Give away stickers at the front desk, if they've arrived.
- Post on your socials
