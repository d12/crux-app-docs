## Gym info

The gym info section allows you to customize how your gym is displayed in the app. You can set your gym's name, location, description, and public email that climbers can use to reach you.

## Staff members

The staff members section allows you to add and remove staff members from your gym. Staff members have access to moderation tools and can set [official climbs](/docs/documentation-for-gym-staff/about-crux/optional-feature-gym-set-climbs.md) if you've enabled them.

Only staff members with the "Admin" permission will be allowed to access the gym settings.
