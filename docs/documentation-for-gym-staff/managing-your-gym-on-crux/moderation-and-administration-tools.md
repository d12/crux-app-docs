# Moderation and Administration Tools

Gym staff have access to **moderation tools** to help manage their gym’s content on Crux. These tools allow staff to:
- Moderate **comments**
- Delete **inappropriate content**
- Manage **climbs, lists, and users**

---

## Who Can Moderate Content?

Only **gym staff** listed in the
[**Staff Members section**](/docs/documentation-for-gym-staff/managing-your-gym-on-crux/gym-settings-and-staff-members.md)
can moderate content on your gym’s page.

---

## How Moderation Works

Most moderation actions can be performed by tapping the **"..." button** on the content you want to manage.
This will open a **menu with moderation options**.
