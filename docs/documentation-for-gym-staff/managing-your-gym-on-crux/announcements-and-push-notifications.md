# Announcements and Push Notifications

Crux is the **only** climbing app that lets you send **free-form push notifications** directly to your climbers.

Since **emails often end up in spam** and **social media can be unreliable**, push notifications provide a **direct and effective way** to communicate with your community.

---

## Who Receives Push Notifications?

When you post an announcement, **all climbers at your gym** who have:
- **Installed Crux**
- **Enabled push notifications**

…will receive a **push notification**.

Want to know how many climbers are receiving or opening your notifications?
[Email us](mailto:contact@cruxapp.ca), and we’ll provide insights!

---

## Who Can Send Announcements?

Only **gym staff** listed in the [Staff Members section](/docs/documentation-for-gym-staff/managing-your-gym-on-crux/gym-settings-and-staff-members.md) can send announcements to climbers.

---

## How to Send an Announcement

Announcements are posted in the **Activity Feed** below your gym's main page in the Crux app.

### Steps to Post an Announcement:
1. Open the **Crux app** and navigate to your **gym’s main page**.
2. Tap the **arrow next to the blue "Post" button** and select
   **"Post as (Your Gym Name)."** _(This is required to send push notifications.)_
3. Write your **announcement** in the text box. _(Optional: Add a photo.)_
4. Tap **"Post."**

That’s it!
