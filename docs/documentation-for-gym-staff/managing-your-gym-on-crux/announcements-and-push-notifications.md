# Announcements and push notifications

Crux is the only climbing app that lets you send completely free-form push notifications directly to your climbers. Since email often gets lost in spam and social media can be unreliable, this feature can make Crux one of your most powerful tools for communicating with your climbers.

## Who we send push notifications to

When you make an announcement, we'll send a push notification to all climbers at your gym who have installed Crux and have allowed push notifications. If you're curious how many climbers exactly that is, or how many climbers are opening your notifications, please [email us](mailto:contact@cruxapp.ca) and we can help out.

## Who can send announcements

Only gym staff listed in the [staff members section](/docs/documentation-for-gym-staff/managing-your-gym-on-crux/gym-settings-and-staff-members.md) of Crux can send announcements to your climbers.

## How to send an announcement

Announcements are posted using the Activity Feed just below your main gym page in the Crux app. To post an announcement, follow these steps:

1. Open the Crux app and navigate to your gym's main page.
2. Click the arrow beside the blue "Post" button and select "Post as (your gym name)". This is required to send push notifications.
3. Write your announcement in the text box and click "Post". You can optionally include a photo.

That's it!
