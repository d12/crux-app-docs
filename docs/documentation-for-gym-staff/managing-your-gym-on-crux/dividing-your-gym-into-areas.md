# Dividing Your Gym into Areas

Unlike other climbing apps that organize climbs by **wall photo**, Crux allows climbers to **set climbs anywhere in the gym** using their own photos.

By default, climbs are **pooled together**, but gyms can **organize them into "areas"** for better navigation and management.

---

## What Are Areas?

An **area** is a distinct section of your gym that climbers can easily identify by name.
Examples include:
- **Bouldering Cave**
- **45° Spray Wall**
- **Top Rope Wall**

### Benefits of Using Areas:
- **Easier navigation** – Climbers can **search and filter climbs** by area.
- **Simplified setting** – Climbers **select an area** when setting a new climb.
- **Better gym management** – Gym staff can **unset climbs by area** when resetting sections.

Enabling areas makes it **easier for climbers to find climbs** and helps **gym staff manage resets** efficiently.
