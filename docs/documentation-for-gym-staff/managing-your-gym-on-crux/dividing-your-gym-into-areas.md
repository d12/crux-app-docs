# Dividing your gym into areas

Since Crux lets climbers set in any area of the gym using their own photos, we don't orgnize climbs by wall photo like most other apps. Instead, climbs are pooled together by default, and can be organized by defining "areas" in your gym.

## What are areas?

An area is a distinct part of your gym that climbers can identiy by name. For example, "Bouldering cave", "45Â° Spray", or "Top rope wall". When you enable areas in your gym, climbers are asked to specify the location of new climbs when setting. Climbers can also search and sort climbs by area, and gym staff can unset climbs by area when an area is reset. Overall, areas make it easier for climbers to find climbs and for staff to manage climbs.

## How do I enable areas?

To enable areas in your gym, reach out to Crux at [contact@cruxapp.ca](mailto:contact@cruxapp.ca) and we'll set them up for you.
