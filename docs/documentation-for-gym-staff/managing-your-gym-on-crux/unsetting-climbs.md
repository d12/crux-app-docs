# Unsetting climbs

To unset custom climbs in your gym, navigate to the gym settings by clicking the settings button in the top left of your gym page. Then, click "Unset custom climbs". This will open the dialog for unsetting custom climbs.

If your gym is [divided into areas](/docs/documentation-for-gym-staff/managing-your-gym-on-crux/dividing-your-gym-into-areas.md), you can choose to unset climbs for the entire gym or for specific areas.
