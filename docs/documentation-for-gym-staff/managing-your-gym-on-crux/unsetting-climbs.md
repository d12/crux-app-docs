# Unsetting Climbs

To **unset custom climbs** in your gym:
1. Open **gym settings** by tapping the **settings button** in the top-left of your gym page.
2. Select **"Unset Custom Climbs."**
3. This will open the **unsetting dialog**, where you can choose which climbs to remove.

If your gym is **[divided into walls](/docs/documentation-for-gym-staff/managing-your-gym-on-crux/gym-walls-and-areas.md.md)**, you can:
- **Unset climbs for the entire gym.**
- **Unset climbs for specific walls only.**
